# lif-convert

Tool to convert LIF files (generated by (FinishLynx Photo-Finish Timing Software)[https://finishlynx.com/product/software/finishlynx-results-software/]),
which are CSV files to a HTML table.

In practice, these tables are used on a separate web page to display close-to-real-time results for Athletics meetings I assist with.
